# UK_ROAD-ACCIDENT-ANALYSIS-2021-2022-
 I carried out some data analysis using Power BI and generated some interesting insights and recommendations using the United Kingdom road accidents dataset (demo)

UK ROAD ACCIDENT PROJECT:
My first step in this project was identifying and understanding the Primary and secondary KPIs

Primary KPIs
1. Total casualties and Total accidents for current year and Year on year growth.
2. Total casualties by accident severity for current year and Year on year growth.

Secondary KPIs
1. Total casualties with respect to vehicle type for current year.
2. Monthly trends showing comparison of casualties for current and previous year.
3. Casualties by Road type for current year.


After that, I enlisted some stakeholders such as; Traffic management agencies, The police, Road transportation Department, Ministry of transport, Media and Public.

Moving forward, I begun the real data analysis project using the following steps:
1. Data overview: Here, I took time to understand the data and look through carefully in Excel.
2. Connect data with Power BI
3. Data cleaning and transformation in PowerBI
4. Data processing using DAX functions.
5. Data Modelling
6. Data visualizations and report building.


Gainful INSIGHTS:
1. Total current year (2022) casualties in the Uk reduced by 11.9% with 196,000 people affected compared to the previous year.
2. The current year accidents affected 144,000 people with an 11.7% reduction as compared to the previous year.
3. Casualties in both 2021 and 2022 reach their peak in November.
4. The highest current year accidents happened on single-lane roads.
5. The top 3 vehicle types contributing to current year casualties are: Cars, Vans and Bikes.



Top 3 recommendations.
1. All single-lane roads should be converted to double-lane roads to reduce the accident rate on those roads.
2. The government should provide extra sensitization, traffic regulations and safety to road users (especially Car, Van and bike riders) , to reduce the death rate.
3. More focus needs to be put on urban areas as they have a high rate of 61.95% current year casualties, hence, more road networks should be built, stricter traffic rules and management should be put in urban areas to help ease traffic and in turn reduce accident rate.
